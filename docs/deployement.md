# Deployment Options: Docker vs. Ubuntu Service

We've prepared two alternative deployment options for your warehouse management system:

## Option 1: Docker Deployment
- **What it is**: Container-based deployment that packages your application and its dependencies
- **Key files**:
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `docker-compose.yml`
  - `nginx/conf/warehouse.conf`
- **Command to deploy**: `docker-compose up -d`
- **Advantages**:
  - Consistent environment across development and production
  - Easier scaling
  - Isolated dependencies
  - Works the same way on any OS that runs Docker

## Option 2: Ubuntu/Linux Systemd Service
- **What it is**: Traditional deployment directly on the server
- **Key files**:
  - `warehouse.service` (systemd service file)
  - `gunicorn_config.py`
- **Commands to deploy**:
  ```bash
  sudo cp warehouse.service /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable warehouse
  sudo systemctl start warehouse
  ```
- **Advantages**:
  - Direct control over system resources
  - Potentially lighter weight
  - Better for sysadmins familiar with traditional Linux administration

## Which Should You Choose?

- **Choose Docker if**: 
  - You want simplified deployment and scaling
  - You're working with multiple environments
  - You want to avoid "it works on my machine" problems

- **Choose Systemd if**:
  - You have existing Linux administration experience
  - Your server resources are limited
  - You need deeper integration with the host system

Both options are production-ready - it's primarily a matter of your team's experience and infrastructure preferences.
